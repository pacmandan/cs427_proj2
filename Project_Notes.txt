This project consists of three parts: Puzzle, Strategy, and Solver

Puzzle:
A file containing the definition of the problem to solve.
Answers every question asked in class about defining a search problem:
-	What do our states look like?
-	What is a valid state?
-	How much does it cost to transition between states?
-	What are our start/goal states?
-	Etc.

Strategy:
A file containing rules for searching using a particular startegy.
We'll need BFS, DFS, and Best-First Search (HFS).
This file contains rules concerning how the search will be performed.


Solver:
Applies the rules defined in Strategy to the states defined in Puzzle.
-	Tests if State is equal to OtherState.
-	Enumerate all valid Moves from State.
Outputs the states visited by the solver in the order that they were visted,
and the found sequence of states connecting Start to Goal.
