Heuristics explanation
**********************************

Vampire/Werewolf puzzle heuristic

Our states were modeled such that we only keep
track of how many vampires and werewolves are
on the starting side of the river. For example,
since the puzzle starts with 3 vampires and
3 werewolves on the starting side, that state is
represented as [3,3].

Since the goal state is to get everyone on the
opposite side of the river (i.e. [0,0]), the heuristic
for this puzzle is simply the total number of beings
on the starting side of the river, with lower numbers
being better.

Example:
	2 vampires and 1 werewolf on starting side
	--> Heuristic = 2 + 1 = 3

***********************************

Black-white puzzle heuristic

We chose a rather simple heuristic for this one.
The heuristic is simply 3 minus the total number of whites
on the left side (before hitting a black token). A lower
heuristic value means more desirable state.

For example:
[w,blank,w,b,w,b,b] --> Heuristic = 3 - 2 = 1
 *       * ^

[b,w,blank,w,b,b,w] --> Heuristic = 3 - 0 = 3
 ^

************************************

We also factored edge cost into the heuristics, but that's
accomplished in the HFS solver directly, rather than in the puzzle.
When HFS compares two heuristics, it compares the heuristic
value of the new state + the edge cost to get to that state.

Since lower is better, a low heuristic value with a low edge cost
will be chosen over a high heuristic value with a high edge cost.
